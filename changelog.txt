Version 3.14.0:
===============
- Improved usage of network bandwidth for snapshot requests
    Optimized the network bandwidth usage between endpoints and Bloomberg data
    centers for snapshot requests. Customers can request to disable the
    optimization by setting the 'bandwidthSaveModeDisabled' session option.

- Stability and performance improvements

Version 3.13.1:
===============
- Conversions to string using print helpers ignore null-terminators
	Previously, when converting an e.g., Element to string explicitly,
	or when printing it, null-terminators embedded in strings
	would cause the resulting string to be truncated to the first one.

- Format docstrings to be rendered by the Sphinx documentation generator
- Stability and performance improvements

Version 3.13.0:
===============
- Automated network configuration for ZFP over leased lines
    Allow customers that leverage leased lines/routers for Bloomberg services
    (such as existing Bloomberg terminals) to use this infrastructure to
    connect their applications to Zero Foot-Print (ZFP) instances.

    A new utility class, 'blpapi.ZfpUtil', can be used to create a
    'SessionOptions' object with the appropriate servers. Applications can
    update the options, including authorization settings, but should not
    change the servers.

    Added a new example ZfpOverLeasedLinesSessionExample.py to demonstrate
    how to create a session over ZFP leased lines.

- Stability and performance improvements
